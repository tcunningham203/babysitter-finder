# CubCare

## Description
CubCare is a childcare website where parents can match with babysitters (based on a questionaire) and can select babysitters to care for their children. This app is designed for both parents and babysitters to benefit, where parents can gain the time off that they have needed away from their kids, while babysitters can earn an income by babysitting their children.  This app is targeted to parents and babysitters living inside the borough of Manhattan in NYC.

## Credits

- Educational resources like W3Schools, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT were used to help our team better understand concepts and fine-tune our vision.
- The second commit titled "Starter Code and file structure from Mini Project" had the file structure taken from the mini project in Module 21 to act as a starting point. Most of the files say things like "insert code here", but some of them, like the package.json files, were taken directly. However, as the project went on, certain dependencies were added and removed to better suit our needs for this project.
